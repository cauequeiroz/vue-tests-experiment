# Vue Tests Experiment

This repository hosts my experiments with unit testing on a Vue.js application. The initial application was given by a course about [Vue.js Unit Tests with Jest](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/vuejs-testes-unitarios-automatizados-jest). After finish this course, I made a few extras implementations:

- Migrate every test from `vue-test-utils` to `testing-library/vue`
- Unit test the http module
- Increase components coverage
